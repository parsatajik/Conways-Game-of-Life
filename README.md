# Conways-Game-of-Life
My implementation of the famous Conway's Game of Life using Processing.

The rules are simple. In each round, every cell interacts with at most 8 adjacent members and during each step the following transitions will occur:

  1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (referred to as underpopulation or exposure).
  2) Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (referred to as overpopulation or overcrowding).
  3) Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.
  4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours will come to life.
  
  
 # Running Instruction
 
 To run the program simply open the code in the Processing IDE and add your desired cells to the matrix using mouse clicks. Press 'a' to start/pause the program. press 'c' to clear the matrix.
